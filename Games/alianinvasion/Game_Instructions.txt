In Alian Invasion, the player contrals arocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. 
When the game begins, a fleer of alians fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. 
If the player shoots all the alians, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
