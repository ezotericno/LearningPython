- Lists
  - A list is a collection of items in a particular order. ```[ ]``` indicates a list item,
  - You can call specific items from a list using ```list[0]```
  - This wont call the entire list, just whatever items are passed in the argument
  - Lists are started at position 0, so the first item will be counted as item number 0 and so on
  - You can also use a list item in an f-string
    - EG ```f"This is my favrourite {car[2].title()}"```
