- Lists
  - A list is a collection of items in a particular order. ```[ ]``` indicates a list item,
  - You can call specific items from a list using ```list[0]```
  - This wont call the entire list, just whatever items are passed in the argument
  - Lists are started at position 0, so the first item will be counted as item number 0 and so on
  - You can also use a list item in an f-string
    - EG ```f"This is my favrourite {car[2].title()}"```

  - .pop() method
    - Pops an item out from the end of a list, but allows it to be worked with still inside of the program
    - You can state a specific item with pop by inputting the position in the arguement
    -EG ```motorcycles.pop(2)```
