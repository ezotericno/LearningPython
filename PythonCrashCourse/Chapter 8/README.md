# Arguments and Parameters
Functions with arguments require that one is given in order to run. 

# Passing Arguments
Positional arguments need to be in the same order in which they were written; keyword arguments, where each argument has a veriable name and a value; and lists and dictionaries
of values. Each of these will have an example program contained in this folder. 

# Return Values
When a function processes data then returns a value or a set of values. 

#Preventing a function from modifying a list

You can send a copy of a list to a function like this:
```function_name(list_name[:])```

- Try to always have a docstring with your function. It helps whoever is reading the code to understand the meaning behind it.
