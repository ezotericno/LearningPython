# Chapter 2 Reference page

- Variables are labels that have values in them
    ```thisThing = thisValue```
    ```printThis = print(this)```

- Strings are a series of characters
    ```"This is a string"```
    ```'This is also a string'```

- .title, .upper, .lower
    - string operators change the case of a string

- \n, \t
    - add whitespace or print things on a new line

- .strip, .lstrip, .rstrip
    - this method removes whitespace from a string

- Floats
    - Any number with a decimal point is a float number
 
- Integer
    - any number without a decimal point is considered an integer
 
- With long numbers in python, underscores are ignored when printed

- Multiple Assignment
    - You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line
    - EG ```x, y, z = 0, 0, 0``` Python will assign each value to its respective positioned variable

- Constants
    - Like a variable, but the value does not change. Indicated by a variable name with all capital letters
    - EG ```MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000```
 
- Comments
    - Very useful tool for indicating what a program does or what a line of code does.
    - Comments are ignored by the interpretor and indicated by a hashmark ```# This is a comment```
